what bees are and why we need them

Bees are a living creature that can pollonate flowers to keep them alive. We need bees so we can have beautiful flowers, and honey. We also need them so they can fertilize crops.





Problem bees are facing

Bees are facing a problem with people and pesticides. Gardeners spray pesticides on flower and othe plants so no bug eat them or ruins the crop. When they spray the pesticide they kill and bug or insect around it. This means if a bee lands on a flower that has been sprayed, it will obtain the poison and the bee will eventually die. We need to help them so they can do what they are suppose to do, make honry and pollinate. So how can we do ths?





How can you help

Helping a bee can bee can be as easy as planting a flower or to raise money. Me and my team are going to raise money from buying and selling seeds. This will then allow us to send the money to a company. They will then use the money to find a new way to save bees.


Please raise money to help awareness of the Colony Collapse Disorder.
